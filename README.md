ATProtoKit is an easy-to-understand API library that leverages the AT Protocol with the type-safety and ease-of-use you’ve come to expect with the Swift programming language. Whether you’re building a bot, a server app, or just another user-facing Bluesky client, this project should hopefully get you up to speed.


## Example Usage
```swift
let config = ATProtocolConfiguration(handle: "example.bsky.social", appPassword: "app-password")

Task {
    let session = try await config.authenticate()
    switch session {
        case .success(let result):
            let atProto = ATProtoKit(session: result)
            let postResult = await atProto.createPostRecord(text: "Hello Bluesky!")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }
}
```

## Motivation
I believe Bluesky and its accompanying AT Protocol gives the perfect balance between embracing decentralization and simplifying the user experience. Because of this, I wanted a way for Swift developers to use the AT Protocol in a way that feels right at home, both client-side with Apple's platforms, and server-side with Linux. For this reason, I decided to open source this project.


## Features
- [x] Full compatibility with Apple’s APIs for each of the platforms.
- [x] Written with adherence to the Swift API Design Guidelines.
- [ ] Well-written documentation for all of the AT Protocol and Bluesky APIs.
- [x] A RichText helper to parse text into the applicable facets.
- [ ] Extend the capabilities of the classes in case your project requires it.
- [ ] A powerful Firehose API that retrieves and filters events and records in real-time.
- [ ] An HTML-parsing system to grab search engine-friendly elements for embeds.
- [x] A logging tool for easy debugging.

\* _Not all features above have been implemented; however, they will be, soon._


## Installation
You can use the Swift Package Manager to download and import the library into your project:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MasterJ93/ATProtoKit.git", from: "0.11.0")
]
```

Then under `targets`:
```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        // name: ...,
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "ATProtoKit", package: "atprotokit")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Roadmap
The Projects page isn't set up yet, so it'll be a while before you can see the progress for this project. However, some of the goals include:
- Making the library fully compatible for Linux, for both client-side and server-side applications.
- Replacing SwiftSoup to a more laser-focused Swift package dedicated for the AT Protocol and Bluesky.
- Adding a separate package for auto-generating lexicons based on the Swift API Design Guidelines, Swift best practices, and this project’s own API design guidelines.

## Quick Start
As shown in the Example Usage, it all starts with `ATProtocolConfiguration`, which uses the handle, app password, and pdsURL to access and create a session:
```swift
import ATProtoKit

let config = ATProtocolConfiguration(handle: "lucy.bsky.social", appPassword: "app-password")
```

By default, `ATProtocolConfiguration` conforms to `https://bsky.social`. However, if you’re using a different distributed service, you can specify the URL:
```swift
let result = ATProtocolConfiguration(handle: "lucy.example.social", appPassword: "app-password", pdsURL: "https://example.social")
```

This session contains all of the elements you need, such as the access and refresh tokens:
```swift
Task {
    let session = try await config.authenticate()

    switch session {
        case .success(let result):
            print("Result (Access Token): \(session.accessToken)")
            print("Result (Refresh Token): \(session.refreshToken)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Requirements
To use ATProtoKit in your apps, your app should target the specific version numbers:
- **iOS** and **iPadOS** 15 or later.
- **macOS** 12 or later.
- **tvOS** 15 or later.
- **watchOS** 8 or later.
- **visionOS** 1 or later.

> [!WARNING]
> As of right now, Linux support is theoretically possible, but not guaranteed to be tested. The plan is to make it fully compatible with Linux by version 1.0, though this is not a required goal to get there. For other platforms (such as Android), this is also not tested, but should be theoretically possible. While it’s not a goal to make it fully compatible, contributions and feedback on the matter are welcomed.
