> ***This API library is highly unstable. Things will change. Things are incomplete. Things will break. Until the project reaches version 1.0.0, stability will not be guaranteed.***

ATProtoKit is an easy-to-understand API library that leverages the AT Protocol with the type-safety and ease-of-use you’ve come to expect with the Swift programming language. Whether you’re building a bot, a server app, or just another user-facing Bluesky client, this project should hopefully get you up to speed.

This Swift package mainly focuses on the client side of the AT Protocol. This is essentially a combination of the [`api`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/api) and [`xrpc`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/xrpc) packages from the official [`atproto`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto) TypeScript repository.


## Example Usage
```swift
let config = ATProtocolConfiguration()

Task {
    print("Starting application...")

    do {
        try await config.authenticate(with: "lucy.bsky.social", password: "hunter2")

        let atProtoKit = await ATProtoKit(sessionConfiguration: config)
        let atProtoBluesky = ATProtoBluesky(atProtoKitInstance: atProtoKit)

        let postResult = try await atProtoBluesky.createPostRecord(text: "Hello Bluesky!")

        print(postResult)
    } catch {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Motivation
I believe Bluesky and its accompanying AT Protocol gives the perfect balance between embracing decentralization and simplifying the user experience. Because of this, I wanted a way for Swift developers to use the AT Protocol in a way that feels right at home, both client-side with Apple's platforms, and server-side with Linux. For this reason, I decided to open source this project.


## Features
- [x] Full compatibility with Apple’s APIs for each of the platforms.
- [x] Written with adherence to the Swift API Design Guidelines.
- [ ] Well-written documentation for all of the AT Protocol and Bluesky APIs.
- [x] A RichText helper to parse text into the applicable facets.
- [x] Easily validate different identifiers.
- [ ] A powerful Firehose API that retrieves and filters events and records in real-time.
- [ ] A logging tool for easy debugging.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all features above have been implemented; however, they will be, soon.


## Installation
You can use the Swift Package Manager to download and import the library into your project:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MasterJ93/ATProtoKit.git", from: "0.30.0")
]
```

Then under `targets`:
```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        // name: "[name of target]",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "ATProtoKit", package: "atprotokit")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Roadmap
The Projects page isn't completed, but you can still view it through its [Projects](https://github.com/users/MasterJ93/projects/2) page.

## Quick Start
As shown in the Example Usage, it all starts with `ATProtocolConfiguration`:
```swift
import ATProtoKit

let config = ATProtocolConfiguration()
```

By default, `ATProtocolConfiguration` conforms to `https://bsky.social`. However, if you’re using a different distributed service, you can specify the URL:
```swift
let result = ATProtocolConfiguration(pdsURL: "https://example.social")
```

After that, use the `authenticate()` method, and pass in the handle and password of the user account. Once you've passed in the `ATProtocolConfiguration` object to the `ATProtoKit` `class`, use the `getUserSession()` method, as well as the `ATProtocolConfiguration.sessionConfiguration.keychainProtocol` property. These two contains all of the elements you need, such as the session tokens, decentralized identifier (DID), and service endpoint:
```swift
Task {
    do {
        try await config.authenticate(with: "lucy.bsky.social", appPassword: "hunter2")

        // The session object is contains in the `ATProtoKit` object:
        let atProtoKit = ATProtoKit(sessionConfiguration: config)

        if let keychain = try await atProtoKit.keychainProtocol() {
            print("Result (Access Token): \(keychain.retrieveAccessToken())")
            print("Result (Refresh Token): \(keychain.retrieveRefreshToken())")
        }
        
        if let session = try await atProtoKit.getUserSession() {
            print("Result (Service Endpoint): \(session.serviceEndpoint)")
            print("Result (DID): \(session.sessionDID)")
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Requirements
To use ATProtoKit in your apps, your app should target the specific version numbers:
- **iOS** and **iPadOS** 14 or later.
- **macOS** 13 or later.
- **tvOS** 14 or later.
- **visionOS** 1 or later.
- **watchOS** 9 or later.

For Linux, you need to use Swift 6.0 or later. On Linux, the minimum requirements include:

- **Red Hat UBI** 9
- **Ubuntu** 20.04

You can also use this project for any programs you make using Swift and running on **Docker**.

> [!WARNING]
> As of right now, Windows support is theoretically possible, but not has not been tested to work. While it’s not a goal to make it fully compatible, contributions and feedback on the matter are welcomed.
> 
> Support for WebAssembly is currently not supported, but will be soon. Support for Android will be supported soon.
