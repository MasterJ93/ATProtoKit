# Security Policy

## Version Support
Currently, the latest version of `ATProtoKit` supports security vulnerability reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please don’t report possible security vulnerabilities in public forums, channels, or services. This includes the Issues section on GitHub, Discord, or some other service. Instead, please go to Security > Advisories and click on [New Draft Security Advisory](https://github.com/MasterJ93/ATProtoKit/security/advisories/new). Alternatively, you can email me at [security@cjrriley.com](mailto:security@cjrriley.com?subject=ATProtoKit%20Security%20Vulnerability:%20[ENTER%20TITLE%20HERE])
 with the subject line “ATProtoKit Security Issue: [title of vulnerability]. Please type out what you found, how to reproduce the steps, a possible link to a sample project that can reproduce the error, and any other additional information that could help me fix the problem.

I will get back to you within three business days, along with a follow-up when I fix the vulnerabilities. Once I fixed it, you’re free to discuss it.

- Your name; whether it’s:
    - First and last name (optional)
    - Your username on some Git service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) (optional)
