    /// Looks for user profiles (actors) matching the search term.
    /// 
    /// This will search for the display names, descriptions, and handles within the user profiles.
    /// However, this API call can only return results of a matching handle. If you want search
    /// suggestion (where it returns results based on a partial term instead of the exact term),
    /// a different method is needed.
    ///
    /// - Bug: According to the AT Protocol specifications, this API call does not require
    /// authentication. However, there's an issue where it asks for authentication if there's
    /// no `accessToken`. It's unknown whether this is an issue on the AT Protocol's end or
    /// `AKProtoKit`'s end. For now, use the `shouldAuthenticate` parameter when
    /// using this method.
    ///
    /// - Note: According to the AT Protocol specifications: "Find actors (profiles) matching search criteria. Does not require auth."
    ///
    /// - SeeAlso: This is based on the [`app.bsky.actor.searchActors`][github] lexicon.
    ///
    /// [github]: https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/app/bsky/actor/searchActors.json
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - query: The string used against a list of actors.
    ///   - limit: The number of suggested users to follow. Optional. Defaults to `25`.
    ///   Can only choose between 1 and 100.
    ///   - cursor: The mark used to indicate the starting point for the next set of
    ///   results. Optional.
    ///   - accessToken: The access token
    ///   - pdsURL: The URL of the Personal Data Server (PDS). Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - shouldAuthenticate: Indicates whether the method will use the access token
    ///   when sending the request. Defaults to `false`.
    /// - Returns: A `Result`, containing either ``AppBskyLexicon/Actor/SearchActorsOutput``
    /// if successful, and an `Error` if not.
