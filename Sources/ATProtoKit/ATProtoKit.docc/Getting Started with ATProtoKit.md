## Overview

ATProtoKit is designed to make it easy for you to interact with the AT Protocol and other services built on of the technology, such as Bluesky. 

### Creating a session

In order to log in, you need to create a session. To get started, create a new ``ATProtocolConfiguration`` instance:

```swift
let config = ATProtocolConfiguration(handle: "lucy.bsky.social", appPassword: "g8DBhaj-948uBho-Zh6c8Wl")
```
 
> Important: Do not use the password you typically use for signing into Bluesky: only use a specific App Password that's in use for this instance of ATProtoKit only. To generate an App Password, go to the Bluesky website, then go to Settings > Advanced > App Passwords and follow the instructions.

Then, you can create a session with the ``ATProtocolConfiguration/authenticate(authenticationFactorToken:)`` method:

```swift
Task {
    try await config.authenticate()
}
```

You can use a `do-catch` block to create the ``UserSession`` object (if the session was successfully created) or handle the error (if an error occured):

```swift
let config = ATProtocolConfiguration(handle: "lucy.bsky.social", appPassword: "hunter2")

Task {
    do {
        try await config.authenticate()

        // Handle the success.
    } catch {
        // Handle the error.
    }
}
```

> Note: If you've enabled Two-Factor Authentication (via email), you may see an `AuthFactorTokenRequired` error. In that case, check your inbox for a code, then call ``ATProtocolConfiguration/authenticate(authenticationFactorToken:)`` again, but put in the code for the `authenticationFactorToken` parameter.

``UserSession`` will contain, among other things, the access and refresh tokens. ATProtoKit abstracts this away for you so you don't need to add it every time you use a method that requires an active session.

You can then create an ``ATProtoKit/ATProtoKit`` instance, where you can insert the ``ATProtocolConfiguration`` object in the `sessionConfiguration` parameter:

```swift
Task {
    let atProto = await ATProtoKit(sessionConfiguration: config)
}
```

### Creating a post
To create a post, first create an ``ATProtoBluesky`` instance, with the ``ATProtoKit/ATProtoKit`` instance as the parameter:
```swift
let atProtoBluesky = ATProtoBluesky(atProtoKitInstance: atProto)
```

Then use the ``ATProtoBluesky/createPostRecord(text:inlineFacets:locales:replyTo:embed:labels:tags:creationDate:recordKey:shouldValidate:swapCommit:)`` method. While this method is extremely extensive, we're only going to focus on the `text` parameter.

```swift
let postResult = try await atProtoBluesky.createPostRecord(text: "Hello Bluesky!")
print(postResult)
```

You should see the post in your Bluesky account once you run this code. When the method successfully completes, you'll receive a ``ComAtprotoLexicon/Repository/StrongReference`` object that contains the URI of the record (``ComAtprotoLexicon/Repository/StrongReference/recordURI``) and the content identifier hash of the record (``ComAtprotoLexicon/Repository/StrongReference/recordCID``).

### View Your Own Posts

To view your own posts, you can use ``ATProtoKit/ATProtoKit/getAuthorFeed(by:limit:cursor:postFilter:shouldIncludePins:)`` and use ``UserSession/handle`` in the first argument:

```swift
do {
    guard let session = atProto.session else { return }
    let myFeed = try await atProto.getAuthorFeed(by: session.handle)
    print("Feed: \(myFeed)")
} catch {
    throw error
}
```

By default, it will grab the first 50 posts from you, including replies, and without the pinned post. However, you can tweak that with the `limit`, `postFilter`, and `shouldIncludePins` arguments. You can also poll more posts if a singular call reaches its limit by using ``AppBskyLexicon/Feed/GetAuthorFeedOutput/cursor`` with the next API call:

```swift
let myFeed = try await atProto.getAuthorFeed(
    by: "lucy.bsky.social",
    limit: 100
)

print("Feed (first 100 posts): \(myFeed)")

// To get the next 100 posts, call the method again,
// but attach the `cursor` as an argument.

let myFeedExtended = try await atProto.getAuthorFeed(
    by: "lucy.bsky.social",
    limit: 100,
    cursor: myFeed.cursor
)

print("Feed (next 100 posts): \(myFeedExtended)")
```
