/// sending API calls to the AT Protocol. Creating a class that conforms to this is useful if you
/// have additional lexicons specific to the service you're running.
///
/// For logging-related tasks, make sure you set up the logging instide the `init()` method
/// and attach it to the `logger` property.
/// ```swift
/// public init(session: UserSession? = nil, logIdentifier: String? = nil, logCategory: String?, logLevel: Logger.Level? = .info) {
///     self.session = session
///     self.logger = session?.logger ?? logger
