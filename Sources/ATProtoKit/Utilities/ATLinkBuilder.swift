/// A protocol used to easily access the metadata for a website.
///
/// To use this protocol, attach it to a `struct` of your creation, then implement
/// ``ATLinkBuilder/grabMetadata(from:)`` based on whatever method you would use to access
/// the title.
///
/// The `url` property would simply be the link captured from the `link` arguement, so you can
/// simply pass through that argument as the `url` property.
///
/// The `description` property is optional since some websites may not contain one.
/// It's recommended that you either add some text saying not description is provided, or by
/// some other means (e.g.: the beginning of an article in the webpage).
///
/// - Note: For more information about using this `protocol`, please read the [Creating Link Previews
/// with ATLinkBuilder](<doc:ATLinkBuilderProtocol>) article.

    /// - Returns: A tuple which contains the title, description, and (optionally) the
    /// thumbnail URL of the link.
