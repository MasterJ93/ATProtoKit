    /// which is a 13 ASCII character that consists of `234567abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` with no
    /// padding. The specification also requires that the number never decreases: it must
    /// always increase.
    ///
    /// A specific layout for `UInt64` are as follows:
    /// - Bit 0: `0`
    /// - Bits 1–54: The timestamp in microseconds since UNIX epoch.
    /// - Bits 55–64: The "clock identifier."
    ///
    /// The "clock identifier" is a 10-bit random number between `0` and `1024`, which reduces the
    /// chance of a collision between two Record Keys. However, it's important to note that this
    /// doesn't _guarantee_ that no two Record Keys are alike.
